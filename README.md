# Matrix Calculator

This is a simple matrix calculator program that performs common matrix operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Getting Started

To use the matrix calculator, you will need to compile the program using a C++ compiler such as `g++`. The program consists of three files: `matrixcalculator.h`, `matrixcalculator.cpp`, and `main.cpp`. 

To compile the program, navigate to the directory containing the files and run the following command:

g++ matrixcalculator.cpp main.cpp -o matrixcalculator


This will compile the program and create an executable file called `matrixcalculator`. You can then run the program by typing `./matrixcalculator` in the terminal.

## Usage

When you run the program, you will be prompted to enter the number of rows and columns for two matrices, and then enter the values for each matrix. You will then be prompted to choose an operation to perform on the matrices (+ for addition, - for subtraction, * for multiplication, and / for division).

The program will then perform the selected operation on the matrices and display the resulting matrix.
